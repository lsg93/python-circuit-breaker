This is just a simple project with an SRE bent that I used to try and get used to writing code in Python.

It's really simple, it's just a gateway that implements a circuit breaker for a service. If the service is failing, it shuts things off to prevent unnecessary requests being made.

I just wanted to use it as something somewhat meaningful to set up a Python dev environment, and learn a little bit about FastAPI.
